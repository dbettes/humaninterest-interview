# humaninterest-interview
A quick project I was asked to solve in an interview.  The goal was to remove all comments from the supplied [sample.json](sample.json) file and output the result to the console.  I added additional comments to test other scenarios that could occur for added robustness.  I'm sure there is a more elegant way to do this task, but this is what I came up with first.
